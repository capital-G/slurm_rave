# slurm_rave

A Python CLI to trigger rave training processes in a SLURM environment.

## Setup

> This skips the part on how to setup the SLURM cluster - though it would be nice to also use `uv` for this.

Assuming [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) is installed

```shell
uv run slurm_rave.py
```

Just to be sure, also install RAVE in this environment via `rave pip install acids-rave`.
